We are a small, international remote indie game studio focused on 2D RPGs. Keep an eye out for our currently-in-development game: Train To Teaberry!

### Train To Teaberry

Fresh out of a top 10 alchemy school.. instead of heading to the Great City, you board the train to Teaberry. Explore a quaint town with endearingly strange locals, brew potions to cure the fantastical ailments of the townspeople, and grow and harvest your own ingredients. Currently in development!
